# Memory hack :O
After giving up on this topic too many times im going to try and learn it the right way!

## Goal
A fully working mod for Quake 2 RTX that is loaded via DLL injection.

A write up about my learnings that I will publish onto my personal site. 

I need a job, plz give me a job :( 

## Other info
- Reversing is done using IDA Pro 7.0 
- Only works for 64 bit windows machines using x86 processors 

## Note
- not the best code to read, more a proof of concept
